![Real Life Clayton Bigsby](/img/clayton.jpg)

Ok so a little confession....

The Clayton Bigsby skits on The Dave Chappelle show didn't make me laugh like other people.  Seeing a black man also but deny the heritage and history of his DNA hit different for me.  However some of the jokes were funny and I always thought there would never be that extreme of a black man in real life. It was a parody and the world would never find a black man like that.

Leave it to Black Twitter to prove me wrong.  Clayton Bigsby is alive and well and out here defending confederate statues.

## So What Happened...

A black man named Daniel Sims was a part of a counter protest in Marshall County, Alabama.  Here is the interview he did with WHNT19:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Peak 2020. Plot-twist... <a href="https://t.co/Pr5alHzvKq">pic.twitter.com/Pr5alHzvKq</a></p>&mdash; Rex Chapman🏇🏼 (@RexChapman) <a href="https://twitter.com/RexChapman/status/1293915948722905089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

As soon as this news clip became viral the comparisons to fictional character Clayton Bigsby were so obvious especially with how Mr. Sims was defending the statues and confederate flags.

“Regardless of how the next person feels, I’m not going to take my flag down,” he said in the interview. “If I’ve got anything to do with it, ain’t no monument going to come down.”

Like Clayton, Daniel Sims was adopted into a white family and identifies more with his adopted heritage than with his natural one.

“My whole family is white,” Sims said later in the video, “went to all-white school, grew up in all-white neighborhood. My grandfather was white and he was the main one that fought in this war here. And he’s taught me everything I know.”

Needless to say the discovery of a real-life Clayton Bigsby didn't go well on the Twitter Streets.
