With everything going on in the world it would seem that no one would care about award shows anymore.  Despite all of the social distancing there is a lot of real life unscripted excitement all over the country.

However in 2020 we can definitely say there has been a lot more TV watching than in past years.  Many of us had no other plans that to watch Regina King as Sister Knight in HBO's Watchmen and found the best way to wear a mask to the grocery store.  Fortunately all of that watching has paid off for the limited series because it just snatched 26 noms and will be the key favorite in September.


## So What Happened...

Leslie Jones led a special livestream from Emmys.com to announce the main categories for this years Emmy season.  She was joined virtually by stars Laverne Cox, Josh Gad and Tatiana Maslany.  Together they announced most of the major categories including Outstanding Actor & Outstanding Actress awards.

At the end of the program Leslie congratulated Cox for a guest actress nom for Orange Is The New Black.  The big story though is that the HBO Limited Series Watchmen led the noms with 26 total.  Regina King and Jeremy Irons were nominated for lead actress and lead actor respectively and are highly favored in both categories.

Here are what people are saying about the Emmy noms.
