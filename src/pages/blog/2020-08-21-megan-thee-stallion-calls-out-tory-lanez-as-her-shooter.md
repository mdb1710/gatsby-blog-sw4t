So it's finally official.

Megan Thee Stallion, who just hit No. 1 on Billboard with Cardi B with WAP, has finally named her alleged shooter who injured her foot not too long ago.  We all suspected who it was and he was already arrested in connection with it.  However, until yesterday she refused to openly name the person.  The wait is now over.

She said rapper/singer Tory Lanez shot her in a domestic dispute.  Now Black Twitter and every other online outlet is blowing up.


## So What Happened...

It wasn't on CNN or TMZ where we first heard it. It was on her own Instagram Live that happened last night.


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Megan Thee Stallion confirms that Tory Lanez shot her while she was trying to walk away after an argument. He’s done. <a href="https://t.co/sqpTAY2pmQ">pic.twitter.com/sqpTAY2pmQ</a></p>&mdash; Ronald Isley (@yoyotrav) <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyotrav/status/1296626815440760833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

“Yes ... Tory shot me. You shot me and you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying,” Megan said in her video to Tory. “Stop lying. Why lie? I don’t understand.”

She had recovered from the shooting but in multiple interviews has all but denied that Lanez was the person who shot her twice in the foot.  She is not denying it anymore even though her initial reasons had to do with possible legal reprecussions.

“I didn’t tell the police nothing because I didn’t want us to get in no more trouble,” she said later in the IG live.

Of course Tory Lanez' team is not commenting about the IG live and his legal team is probably advising him to keep quiet. Although the actual shooting is still under investigation Lanez was arrested on suspicion of possession of a concealed weapon the night of the shooting.  He was released on bail but hasn't met in court about that case.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lie one more time and ima quit sparing you</p>&mdash; HOT GIRL MEG (@theestallion) <a href="https://twitter.com/theestallion/status/1296619905777692674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This confession by Megan and the outrage on Twitter doesn't do him any favors.

## The Response

Again Tory's team has yet to respond.  Also it seems LA County is now officially considering a felony assault charge against Tory Lanez.  Of course we will update this post if and when more news arrives.
