![Trump Interview](/img/trump.png)

We all know that Trump has an ego that is always starving for attention.

We all know that President Trump can't fathom the idea that people do not like him and if they don't they are not worthy of him.

We would usually let that be but he has gone to far by insulting the late civil rights pioneer John Lewis in a recent interview.  They weren't friends and they didn't agree on many issues but it would have been better to stay quiet about the man.  Instead he used his name to claim that he has done more for "Black Americans" than any one else.

## So What Happened...

Last night Donald Trump did an exclusive interview with Axios where reporter Jonathan Swan gave him many questions to address the legacy of John Lewis.  Trump of course dodged the questions while making John Lewis's life all about him.  Here are some of the answers he gave:

- "He chose not to come to my inauguration. He chose, I never met John Lewis, I don't believe."

- "I find a lot of people impressive. I find many people not impressive, but no, he didn't come to my inauguration."

-  "He didn't come to my State of the Union speeches, and that's OK. That's his right. And again, nobody has done more for Black Americans than I have. He should've come. I think he made a big mistake."

It was the "Black Americans" quote that has so many Americans, black or otherwise, more upset with the President than they already were.  Here are some responses:

## The Response

Right now there has been no response from Trump about his 'Black Americans' quote.  Of course we will update this post if and when the President or the company takes action.
