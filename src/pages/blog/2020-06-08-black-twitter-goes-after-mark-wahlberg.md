Many celebs have posted their support of the current police protests all over the world. Not only have some of those celebs raised money for bail funds but they have also marched alongside protesters in many cities.

Some however get called out for past actions/words that contradict the support they are currently showing....like Mark Wahlberg.

## So What Happened...

 On June 4th, Wahlberg posted a tweet in response to the outrage about George Floyd's murder.  Here is the tweet:

 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The murder of George Floyd is heartbreaking. We must all work together to fix this problem. I&#39;m praying for all of us. God bless. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#blacklivesmatter</a> ‚ù§üôè‚ù§ <a href="https://t.co/F3UyhT7itQ">pic.twitter.com/F3UyhT7itQ</a></p>&mdash; Mark Wahlberg (@markwahlberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/markwahlberg/status/1268396168352075781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

 Seems normal and good, right? Not so fast. As soon as the tweet was posted many people reminder the actor and the world that his Wikipedia page has a WHOLE HATE CRIMES section about things he did as a teenager. Here are two of the indicents that were mentioned:

 "In June 1986, then-15-year-old Wahlberg and three friends chased after three black children while yelling "Kill the nigger, kill the nigger" and throwing rocks at them.[78] The next day, Wahlberg and others followed a group of mostly black fourth graders (including one of the victims from the previous day) taking a field trip on a beach, yelled racial epithets at them, threw rocks at them, and "summoned other white males who joined" in the harassment.[79][78] In August 1986, civil action was filed against Wahlberg for violating the civil rights of his victims, and the case was settled the next month."

 Another racially charged incident occurred in April 1988. While high on PCP,[83] then-17-year-old Wahlberg assaulted a middle-aged Vietnamese man on the street, calling him a "Vietnam fucking shit" and knocking him unconscious with a large wooden stick. Wahlberg attacked a second Vietnamese man later the same day, punching him in the eye. When Wahlberg was arrested and returned to the scene of the first assault, he told police officers: "I'll tell you now that's the mother-fucker whose head I split open."[84] Investigators also noted that Wahlberg "made numerous unsolicited racial statements about 'gooks' and 'slant-eyed gooks'".[85][86] Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder, pleaded guilty to felony assault, and was sentenced to two years in jail, but served only 45 days of his sentence.[85][87] Wahlberg believed he had left the second victim (named Johnny Trinh) permanently blind in one eye, though Trinh stated that he had lost his eye in the Vietnam War, while serving in the South Vietnamese Army, alongside American troops.

 You can find the other charges on the Wikipedia page about [[Mark Wahlberg]] ([[Special:Permalink/961384602|this version]])
