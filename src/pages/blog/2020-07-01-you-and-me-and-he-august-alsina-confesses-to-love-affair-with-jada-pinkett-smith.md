People have been saying for years that the secret to the happy marriage of Will Smith & Jada Pinkett Smith is that they are not the only ones involved in it.  And by 'the only ones' we don't mean the three children that make them a family. We are talking about the many, many rumors that the Smiths have an open marriage and the many, many people that have supposedly slept in the Smiths' bed.  On Will's side both former co-stars Eva Mendes and Margot Robbie have been said to be sidechicks with an understanding that Jada will always be the main chicks.  On Jada's side no one individual name has stood out when it came to the urban legend of the open marriage.

That is until the latest interview from singer August Alsina.  Now all of Thirsty Twitter is searching for details about the 'relationship' between August & Jada.


## So What Happened...

August Alsina released a new album of material last Friday and has been through a lot in his young life.  To help promote the album he sat down with The Breakfast Club co-host Angela Yee for an hour long interview.  Not only did he talk about his music but he also spilled the tea about the nature of his relationship with the wife of the Fresh Prince.  According to Alsina this was a true love affair although one sided and not just a sexual fling. The rumors about the two have been around for years but after years of denials he feels he has to live in his truth.

Not only did he finally confirm a relationship with Pinkett-Smith he even said that Will Smith gave his blessing.

“I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation,” August began in his answer to Yee. “Due to the transformation from their marriage to life partnership that they’ve spoken on several times, and it not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing. I totally gave myself to that relationship for years of my life and I truly and really really deeply loved and have a ton of love for her. I devoted myself to it. I gave my full self to it. So much so to the point that I can die right now and be okay with knowing that I truly gave myself to somebody. I really loved a person. I experienced that and know what that feels like, and some people never experience that in this lifetime, so I know that I am completely blessed. This conversation is difficult because there’s so much that people don’t understand, but once it starts to affect me and my livelihood, I have to speak up about my truth and stand on my ten with anything that may come along with it.”

Since that interview released everyone and we mean everyone gave their opinion on this 'secret' relationship.
