So the new year has gotten off to a good start despite all of the craziness that has happened in DC since 2021 began.  Georgia officially became an all-blue state and rioters officially tried to stop the official certification of President Elect Joe Biden.  Fortunately things have calmed down politically for the moment and we can concentrate on more relevant matters -- like Plies' teeth.


## So What Happened...

Rapper Plies is mostly known for two things - his flow and his grill.  His grill is not as famous as Paul Wall's but it has been a part of his signature look for years.  Now the new year has left the grill behind in the chaos wake of 2020.  Instead he has a new smile and a new outlook on life

We are happy for Plies and his new teeth (even though no new music has came from him yet) and it seems the rest of the internet is happy for him too.
