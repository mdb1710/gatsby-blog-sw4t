It is only the second day in December


## So What Happened...

So just in case you forgot what happened here is Megan in her own words....


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Megan Thee Stallion confirms that Tory Lanez shot her while she was trying to walk away after an argument. He’s done. <a href="https://t.co/sqpTAY2pmQ">pic.twitter.com/sqpTAY2pmQ</a></p>&mdash; Ronald Isley (@yoyotrav) <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyotrav/status/1296626815440760833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

“Yes ... Tory shot me. You shot me and you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying,” Megan said in her video to Tory. “Stop lying. Why lie? I don’t understand.”

She had recovered from the shooting but in multiple interviews has all but denied that Lanez was the person who shot her twice in the foot.  She is not denying it anymore even though her initial reasons had to do with possible legal reprecussions.

“I didn’t tell the police nothing because I didn’t want us to get in no more trouble,” she said later in the IG live.

Of course Tory Lanez' team is not commenting about the IG live and his legal team is probably advising him to keep quiet. Although the actual shooting is still under investigation Lanez was arrested on suspicion of possession of a concealed weapon the night of the shooting.  He was released on bail but hasn't met in court about that case.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lie one more time and ima quit sparing you</p>&mdash; HOT GIRL MEG (@theestallion) <a href="https://twitter.com/theestallion/status/1296619905777692674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This confession by Megan and the outrage on Twitter doesn't do him any favors.

One week after the release of Lanez' new album , the LAPD officially gave Lanez two felony charges: assault with a semiautomatic firearm and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle. Of course the rapper plans to plead 'not guilty' at his arrainment but that hasn't stopped both his fans and his haters from commenting on the recent charges.
