Lynching is evil. Lynching is murder. Lynching is an abomination.  All of those things are true.

Lynching ended in the 1960s.  Lynching doesn't happen today.  Both of these things are unforturnately false.

So when we heard about the death of CA resident Robert Fuller and how they are treating it as a 'suicide' we at SW4T had to speak up.

## So What Happened...

Robert Fuller was only 23 years young when his body was found hanging from a tree in Palmdale, CA. He was found on June 10th at 4:00 am and later identified via his sister Diamond Alexander.  She was the one who brought attention to her brother's passing by social media.

‚ÄúWords can‚Äôt describe how much my family is hurting right now,‚Äù Alexander said in a Twitter post yesterday. ‚ÄúToday we just got word that Robert body was found hanging in a tree out in Palmdale. ÔøºIt‚Äôs still under investigation. If anyone seen anything please come forward. Brother you will forever be in our heart. RIP.‚Äù

Although many are calling this a lynching, the City of Palmdale declared in their official statement that this tragic death as a suicide with no foul play. Here is what they had to say on their official Facebook page yesterday: 

‚ÄúThe City of Palmdale extends its sincere condolences and sympathies to the family and friends of the individual who tragically passed away in Palmdale on Wednesday. Our thoughts and prayers are with them,‚Äù

In response the City Manager has encouraged those affected by Fuller's death to seek mental health services provided locally in the Los Angeles area.  As this time no further investigation is taking place



## What We Said...

Why it has taken two whole days for this news to circulate is a mystery.  It has now grabbed the attention of black communities across the country and they are demanding justice.
